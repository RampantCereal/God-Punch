# God Punch
 C++ Student Project game

Initially done as part of a course on game development imparted by Javier Agenjo, teacher of the UPF. The basis of the project was his framework which wraps around SDL2 and some of OpenGL's functionality. This was the final project for the course.

A God Hand inspired student project.

Left handed attacks will make you faster but you will deal less damage.

Right handed attacks will make you slower but you will deal more damage.

Alternate attacks to find a comfortable rhythm.

Originally done as a final project in a game development course, as such anything that is not explicitly mine, belongs to their respective creators. I do not claim ownership of God Hand or any related material.
